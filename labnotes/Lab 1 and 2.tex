	\section{Lab 1}
		The goal of this lab is to display the last four digits of my student number (4146) on the 4-digit 7-segment display.
		
		The breadboard's wiring layout resembles this (there are two):
	\begin{verbatim}
		------------------  -------------------
		------------------  -------------------
		| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
		| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
		
		| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
		| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
		------------------  -------------------
		------------------  -------------------
	\end{verbatim}
		In $V_{OH}, V_{IH}, V_{OL}, V_{IL}$, 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The O/I means it's the voltage output/input
		\item The H/L means it's a voltage HI/LO (or 1/0)
	\end{itemize}
		Max and min are the maximum and minimum acceptable voltage for that input/output for HI/LO.
	
		For example, a gate's acceptable voltages may look like the following:
	\begin{verbatim}
		+5V
		|||         max
		|||     V_IH
		|||         min
		 |
		 |
		 |
		|||         max
		|||     V_IL
		|||         min
		=0V
	\end{verbatim}
		The 4-digit 7-segment multiplexed display has seven inputs:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item D3 D2 D1 D0: the input for a single digit, from \texttt{0x0} to \texttt{0xF}
		\item  A1 A0:      the input for selecting a digit, where \texttt{0b11} is leftmost and \texttt{0b00} is rightmost
		\item STR:         when this voltage goes from LO to HI, the value given by Dx is loaded into the digit selected by Ax
	\end{itemize}
		Normally, since a single 7-segment display requires four inputs to display the $2^4 = 16$ different hex digits, 16 inputs would be required to display four digits. However, by using two inputs to select one of the $2^2 = 4$ digits to change and one input to indicate when the digit should be updated, we reduce the total number of inputs to just seven. The width of the latch switch pulse is 30 ns and there is a propagation delay from input to output of 50 ns.
	
		Below is a rough circuit diagramme for wiring up the switches to the Dx inputs, the button to the strobe, and Ax:
	\begin{verbatim}

	\end{verbatim}
		\texttt{SW} indicates a switch, where the up position corresponds to HI and the down position to LO. The \texttt{O} encased in a rectangle connected to the strobe input is the button used to strobe from low to high to allow the display to accept the current inputs. To set the second-left digit to 6, for example, the switches must be in positions [down up up down] and A1 must be connected to power while A0 remains connected to ground. Then press the strobe button and the digit will appear.

	\section{Lab 2}
		Some minor reminders:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Remember to connect +5V and ground to 4-digit 7-segment display, and ground (but \textbf{not} VCC) to microprocessor
		\item \texttt{mspdebug} needs to be exited (with CTRL-D) for the program to run
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Student Number}
		The goal of this activity is to display the last four digits of my student number (4146) using the microprocessor. The pins P1.7 to P1.0 excluding P1.3 have been connected to D3 through D0, then A1 and A0, then STR. Therefore, there needs to be a move to \texttt{P1OUT} for setting each digit. Since the strobe also needs to go from low to high to actually set the digit, there are actually two moves for each digit to alternate the strobe. Below is the full program for setting the display to \texttt{4146}. 
	\begin{alltt}
		.include "msp430g2553.inc"
		
		    org 0xc000
		START:
		    ; setup
		    mov     #0x0400,        SP
		    mov.w   #WDTPW|WDTHOLD, \&WDTCTL
		    mov.b   #11110111b,     \&P1DIR

		    ; disable

	\end{alltt}

	\subsection{Program 1}
		The goal of this activity is to understand the given program in assembly and to modify the blinking speed. The key features to note is that \texttt{xor 0100 0001} is used to alternate the lights from \texttt{0100~0000 -> 0000~0001}, and that the pauses between blinks is achieved by decrementing a register set to some value and waiting until that value becomes zero. Below is the full program for half-speed blinking annotated with comments. Making the lights blink twice as fast is simply halving the initial value set in \texttt{R9}, but making them blink twice as slow involves decrementing another register, since the doubled value is 80000 and will not fit in a two-byte word whose maximum value is 65536.
	\begin{alltt}
		.include "msp430g2553.inc"
		
		    org 0xC000
		START:
		    mov.w   #WDTPW|WDTHOLD, \&WDTCTL
		    mov.b   #0x41,          \&P1DIR  ; #01000001b (P1.6 == LED2, P1.0 == LED1)
		    mov.w   #0x01,          R8      ; #00000001b (start on LED1)
		REPEAT:
		    mov.b   R8,             \&P1OUT
		    xor.b   #0x41,          R8      ; #00000001b -> #01000000b -> ... (LED1 -> LED2 -> ...)
		    mov.w   #40000,         R9      ; counts to decrement before blink
		    mov.w   #40000,         R10     ; counts to decrement (2nd dec, since max val is 65536)
		WAITER1:
		    dec     R9
		    jnz     WAITER1         ; R9 not yet 0
		WAITER2:
		    dec     R10
		    jnz     WAITER2         ; R10 not yet 0
		    jmp     REPEAT          ; R9, R10 == 0; blink other LED
		
		    org 0xfffe
		    dw      START           ; reset interrupt goes to START
	\end{alltt}
	
	\subsection{Program 2}
		The goal of this activity is to understand the given program in assembly and to modify the behaviour from turning the LEDs on and off to turning alternating LEDs on, then both, then off. To make the LEDs cycle in the order
		$$\indent \texttt{none -> red -> green -> both -> none},$$
		the output to P1OUT needs to cycle through
		$$\texttt{0000 0000 -> 0000 0001 -> 0100 0000 -> 0100 0001 -> 0000 0000}.$$ 
		\newpage
		Notice that the first and third transitions
		$$\texttt{0000 0000 -> 0000 0001} \indent and \indent \texttt{0100 0000 -> 0100 0001}$$
		can be done by applying \texttt{xor 0000 0001}, while the second and fourth transitions
		$$\texttt{0000 0001 -> 0100 0000} \indent and \indent \texttt{0100 0001 -> 0000 0000}$$
		can be done by applying \texttt{xor 0100 0001}. Rather than using two registers to save these two constants, notice that in turn the transitions
		$$\texttt{0000 0001 -> 0100 0001 -> 0000 0001}$$
		can be done by applying \texttt{xor 0100 0000}. Therefore we initialize a register, chosen here to be \texttt{R8}, to \texttt{0100~0001} (since the LEDs begin in the both-on state), and after we have applied \texttt{xor R8} on the output to obtain the next output, \texttt{0000~0000}, we apply \texttt{xor 0100~0000} on \texttt{R8} to get the next value of \texttt{R8}, \texttt{0000~0001}, that should be \texttt{xor}ed with the next output, and so forth. Below is the full program annotated with comments. Note that although registers are a word long, we only need the last byte, so all of the \texttt{mov, xor} operations can be for just the byte.
		
	\begin{alltt}
		.include "msp430g2553.inc"
		
		    org 0x0C000
		RESET:
		    mov.w   #0x400,         SP
		    mov.w   #WDTPW|WDTHOLD, \&WDTCTL
		    mov.b   #11110111b,     \&P1DIR      ; all pins outputs except P1.3
		    mov.b   #00001000b,     \&P1REN      ; enable resistor pull for P1.3
		    mov.b   #00001000b,     \&P1IE       ; P1.3 set as an interrupt
		    mov.b   #00001000b,     R7          ; set LEDs off and P1.3 pullup
		    mov.b   R7,             \&P1OUT      ; LED1, LED2 on
		    mov.b   #00000001b,     R8          ; initial value to xor with R7
		    EINT                                ; enable interrupts
		    bis.w   #CPUOFF,        SR
		PUSH:
		    xor.b   R8,             R7          ; next LED state
		    xor.b   #01000000b,     R8          ; 0x0041 -> 0x0001 -> 0x0041
		    mov.b   R7,             \&P1OUT      ; set LEDs to new state
		    bic.b   #00001000b,     \&P1IFG      ; interrupt flag P1.3 set to 0
		    reti                                ; return from interrupt
		    
		    org 0xffe4
		    dw PUSH                             ; interrupt from button goes here
		    
		    org 0xfffe
		    dw RESET                            ; interrupt from reset button goes here
	\end{alltt}
		A problem I was encountering was that my P1.3 button seemed to be unpredictably sending multiple signals sometimes, which gave me difficulty in checking if the LED changing behaviour I had programmed was doing what I expected it to do. Therefore, I wrote a loop at the end of \texttt{PUSH} to keep on executing the LED changes (with a delay), so that I wouldn't have to press the faulty button to change the lights. Below is the full program for this modification.
		
	\begin{alltt}

		    mov.b   #00001000b,     R7          ; set LEDs off and P1.3 pullup
		    mov.b   R7,             \&P1OUT      ; LED1, LED2 on
		    mov.b   #00000001b,     R8          ; initial value to xor with R7
		    EINT                                ; enable interrupts
		    bis.w   #CPUOFF,        SR

		LOOP:
