		The breadboard's wiring layout resembles this (there are two):

		In $V_{OH}, V_{IH}, V_{OL}, V_{IL}$, 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The O/I means it's the voltage output/input
		\item The H/L means it's a voltage HI/LO (or 1/0)
	\end{itemize}
		Max and min are the maximum and minimum acceptable voltage for that input/output for HI/LO.
	
		For example, a gate's acceptable voltages may look like the following:
	\newpage
	\begin{verbatim}
		+5V
		|||         max
		|||
		|||     V_IH
		|||
		|||         min
		|
		|
		|
		|
		|
		|||         max
		|||     V_IL
		|||         min
		=0V
	\end{verbatim}
		The 4-digit 7-segment multiplexed display has seven inputs:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item D3 D2 D1 D0: the input for a single digit, from \texttt{0x0} to \texttt{0xF}
		\item  A1 A0:      the input for selecting a digit, where \texttt{0b11} is leftmost and \texttt{0b00} is rightmost
		\item STR:         when this voltage goes from LO to HI, the value given by Dx is loaded into the digit selected by Ax
	\end{itemize}
	Below is a rough circuit diagramme for wiring up the switches to the Dx inputs, the button to the strobe, and Ax:

		Some minor reminders:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Remember to connect +5V and ground to 4-digit 7-segment display, and ground (but \textbf{not} VCC) to microprocessor
		\item \texttt{mspdebug} needs to be exited (with CTRL-D) for the program to run
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Student Number}
		There needs to be a move to \texttt{P1OUT} for setting each digit. Since the strobe also needs to go from low to high to actually set the digit, there are actually two moves for each digit. Below is the full program for setting the display to \texttt{4146}. 
	\begin{alltt}
		.include "msp430g2553.inc"
		
		    org 0xc000
		START:
		    ; setup
		    mov     #0x0400,        SP
		    mov.w   #WDTPW|WDTHOLD, \&WDTCTL
		    mov.b   #11110111b,     \&P1DIR
		
		    ; set digits		
		    mov.b   #01100000b,     \&P1OUT  ; xxx6
		    mov.b   #01100001b,     \&P1OUT  ; xxx6
		
		    mov.b   #01000010b,     \&P1OUT  ; xx46
		    mov.b   #01000011b,     \&P1OUT  ; xx46
		
		    mov.b   #00010100b,     \&P1OUT  ; x146
		    mov.b   #00010101b,     \&P1OUT  ; x146
		
		    mov.b   #01000110b,     \&P1OUT  ; 4146
		    mov.b   #01000111b,     \&P1OUT  ; 4146
		
		    ; disable
		    bis.w   #CPUOFF,        SR

		    dw      START
	\end{alltt}

	\subsection{Program 1}
		Below is the full program for half-speed blinking annotated with comments. Making the lights blink twice as fast is simply halving the initial value set in \texttt{R9}, but making them blink twice as slow involves decrementing another register, since the doubled value is 80000 and will not fit in a two-byte word whose maximum value is 65536.
	\begin{alltt}
		.include "msp430g2553.inc"
		
		    org 0xC000
		START:
		    mov.w   #WDTPW|WDTHOLD, \&WDTCTL
		    mov.b   #0x41,          \&P1DIR  ; #01000001b (P1.6 == LED2, P1.0 == LED1)
		    mov.w   #0x01,          R8      ; #00000001b (start on LED1)
		REPEAT:
		    mov.b   R8,             \&P1OUT
		    xor.b   #0x41,          R8      ; #00000001b -> #01000000b -> ... (LED1 -> LED2 -> ...)
		    mov.w   #40000,         R9      ; counts to decrement before blink
		    mov.w   #40000,         R10     ; counts to decrement (2nd dec, since max val is 65536)
		WAITER1:
		    dec     R9
		    jnz     WAITER1         ; R9 not yet 0
		WAITER2:
		    dec     R10
		    jnz     WAITER2         ; R10 not yet 0
		    jmp     REPEAT          ; R9, R10 == 0; blink other LED
		
		    org 0xfffe
		    dw      START           ; set reset vector to 'init' label
	\end{alltt}
	
	\subsection{Program 2}
		To make the LEDs cycle in the order
		$$\indent \texttt{none -> red -> green -> both -> none},$$
		the output to P1OUT needs to cycle through
		$$\texttt{0000 0000 -> 0000 0001 -> 0100 0000 -> 0100 0001 -> 0000 0000}.$$ 
		\newpage
		Notice that the first and third transitions
		$$\texttt{0000 0000 -> 0000 0001} \indent and \indent \texttt{0100 0000 -> 0100 0001}$$
		can be done by applying \texttt{xor 0000 0001}, while the second and fourth transitions
		$$\texttt{0000 0001 -> 0100 0000} \indent and \indent \texttt{0100 0001 -> 0000 0000}$$
		can be done by applying \texttt{xor 0100 0001}. Rather than using two registers to save these two constants, notice that in turn
		$$\texttt{0000 0001 -> 0100 0001 -> 0000 0001}$$
		can be done by applying \texttt{xor 0100 0000}. Therefore we initialize a register, chosen here to be \texttt{R8}, to \texttt{0100~0001} (since the LEDs begin in the both-on state), and after we have applied \texttt{xor R8} on the output to obtain the next output, \texttt{0000~0000}, we apply \texttt{xor 0100~0000} on \texttt{R8} to get the next value of \texttt{R8}, \texttt{0000~0001}, that should be \texttt{xor}ed with the next output, and so forth. Below is the full program annotated with comments.
