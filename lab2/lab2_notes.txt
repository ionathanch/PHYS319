Commands:
    - Compile .asm to .hex: `naken430asm -o <name>.hex <name>.asm`
    - Flash to microprocessor: `mspdebug rf2500`, then enter `prog <name>.hex`

Note to self:
    - microprocessor should be grounded; do NOT connect voltage to VCC!
    - remember to connect +5V to 7-segment display
    - connect all wires to microprocessor, then flash, then exit mspdebug!!
      program will not run without exiting
    - max value of a word is 2^16 = 65536, so halving blink rate by double dec count of 40000
      means adding another decrementation of 40000 in another register
